# Not-Quite-Tako

A little emote helper bot for all those nitroless people on discord!

Created by justapyromaniac and NxKarim.

## FAQ

### The bot isn't sending emotes, it's just sending their name
Make sure your @everyone role is allowed to use external emotes. 
Discord uses this role for webhook perms, so it needs to be on for the webhook to use external emotes

### All my cookies are gone
NQT is still quite a Tako, so it eats cookies.
